This is a mental health website interface focused on matching patients with the right therapist, and vice versa.

Research has shown many therapist-client relationships fail due to personality conflicts. Therapists, several times a week, unfortunately have to tell aspiring clients that they would be ineffective counselors and end up turning them down. This leads to many clients failing to receive the help they desire and therapists having empty schedules. 

Our website interface is designed to match clients with the best-fit therapists in their area, basing the machine-learning off of a various amount of features.
