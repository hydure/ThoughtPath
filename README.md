# Thought Path: "me_irl 4u_irl"

This repo contains a mental health website interface focused on matching patients with the right therapist, and vice versa.  We used the MEAN stack design to program the interface.

## Motivation
Research has shown many therapist-client relationships fail due to personality conflicts. Therapists, several times a week, unfortunately have to tell aspiring clients that they would be ineffective counselors and end up turning them down. This leads to many clients failing to receive the help they desire and therapists having lackluster work schedules. Our website interface is designed to match each client with a local therapist best suited for each client's needs using algorithms to determine the best matches.
